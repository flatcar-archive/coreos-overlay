# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Require our ca-certificates package based directly on Mozilla's
# certificate store provided in NSS rather than the Gentoo/Debian package.
>=app-misc/ca-certificates-20000000

# Since version 2, it tries to write liblto symlinks with absolute paths that
# don't work when building for the board root directories.
>=sys-devel/gcc-config-2

# Overwrite portage-stable mask. We are delaying the transition to
# libxcrypt, because we need to figure out how to solve the dep loop
# that results from the migration (python -> virtual/libcrypt ->
# libxcrypt -> glibc -> python), and also we need to update gcc to
# version 10 or later.
>=virtual/libcrypt-2
